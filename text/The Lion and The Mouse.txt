Once upon a time, deep in a quiet forest, under the shade of tall green trees, a mighty lion lay sleeping peacefully. His golden mane glowed under the warm sun, and his tail flicked softly as he dreamed.

Suddenly—pitter patter, pitter patter!—a tiny mouse came scurrying by, chasing a leaf that danced in the wind. Without looking where she was going, the mouse ran right over the lion’s paw!

The lion's eyes flew open. ROAAARRR!
He caught the little mouse with one heavy paw and raised her up in the air by her tail.

“Who dares wake me from my nap?” the lion growled. “I should eat you for this!”

The mouse trembled in fear. “P-please, mighty lion!” squeaked the mouse. “I didn’t mean to bother you. I was just playing!”

The lion narrowed his eyes. “Why should I let you go?”

The mouse, still dangling by her tail, pleaded, “If you let me go, I promise I’ll help you one day!”

The lion burst out laughing. “You? Help me? What could a tiny mouse like you ever do for a strong, brave lion like me?”

But something in the mouse’s tiny voice made the lion pause. With a deep sigh, he set her down gently.

“Very well,” the lion said. “You may go. But be careful where you step next time!”

“Oh, thank you, thank you!” said the mouse, bowing low. “I won’t forget this, I promise!”

And off she scampered into the forest.


Days passed, and the lion went on with his life, roaming the forest and scaring away anyone who dared cross his path.

One afternoon, as the lion was walking near a clearing, he didn’t notice a hunter’s trap hidden in the grass. SNAP! A huge net came down from the trees and trapped him!

The lion roared and thrashed around. “Let me out!” he bellowed. But the more he struggled, the tighter the net became.

The birds flew away. The other animals hid. No one dared to help.

But far away, the little mouse heard the familiar roar. She raced through the grass and found the lion stuck in the net.

“Oh no!” she cried. “Hold still, I’ll help you!”

The lion looked down. “You again?” he said weakly.

The mouse didn’t waste any time. She climbed up the net and began chewing the thick ropes with her sharp little teeth. Bit by bit, the ropes began to snap.

Chew chew chew... SNAP!
Chew chew chew... SNAP!

Soon, a big hole opened in the net, and the lion was free!

He stood up and stretched. “I can’t believe it,” said the lion. “You really did help me.”

The mouse smiled. “You were kind to me once. I never forgot.”

The lion bowed his head. “From now on, we are friends.”

And from that day forward, the mighty lion and the tiny mouse became the unlikeliest of best friends, proving that even the smallest creature can make a big difference.
